        <p> I was born in Lewiston, Maine April 10th 2006. I have lived there my entire life until moving to Syracuse 
            <br> for college. I learned about Syracuse University through social media, and I am so glad I did. 
        <br> I wouldn't want to be anywhere else. In my free time I like to play tennis, do ceramics and read. I love 
    <br>walking my dog and listening to music as well. </p>
